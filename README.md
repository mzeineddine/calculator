Welcome to the Calculator project! This calculator supports three different notations: infix, prefix, and postfix. The calculator is designed to handle basic arithmetic operations using these notations, making it a versatile tool for various computational tasks.

infix notation example: 3 + 4 * 2 / ( 1 - 5 ) = 3 + 4 * 2 / -4 = 3 + 8 / -4 = 3 + -2 = 1
prefix notation example: + 3 * 4 2 / - 1 5
postfix notation example: 3 4 2 * 1 5 - / +
